# Bare-Metal
This repository contains bare-metal programming examples for various peripherals using the STM32G4 microcontroller series. The code is developed using STM32CubeIDE and demonstrates how to configure and use different peripherals without relying on HAL 
Features

GPIO: Input and output configuration.
SysTick: System timer for delay generation.
Timers: Basic timer functionality (PWM, input capture, etc.).
Interrupts: External and peripheral interrupt handling.
I2C: Inter-Integrated Circuit communication(untested).
CAN: Controller Area Network communication(untested).
SPI: Serial Peripheral Interface communication(untested).
